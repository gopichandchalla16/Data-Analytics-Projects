Data Analytics Projects ðŸš€

Welcome to my portfolio repository showcasing two of my data analytics projects, built using Python. These projects demonstrate my skills in data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization to derive actionable insights.

ðŸ“‚ Projects

1. YouTube Data Collection and Analysis
This project involves extracting data from YouTube, processing it, and analyzing key metrics to uncover trends and insights.

Features:

Data Collection:
Utilized the YouTube Data API to fetch metadata such as video titles, views, likes, comments, and publishing dates.

Data Cleaning:
Processed raw JSON responses, removed null/duplicate values, and standardized formats for analysis.

Data Analysis:
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends in video popularity, publishing frequency, and engagement rates.

Visualization:
Created insightful visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn, showcasing metrics like:
Top-performing videos
Engagement patterns over time
Correlation between views and likes

Tech Stack:
Python (pandas, NumPy, requests, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
YouTube Data API

Outcome:
Provided actionable insights on content trends, audience preferences, and best practices for video publishing schedules.

2. Mutual Fund Plan Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing historical mutual fund data to help users make informed investment decisions.

Features:

Data Collection:
Collected historical NAV (Net Asset Value) data for multiple mutual funds using publicly available nifty50 closing prices datasets.

Data Cleaning:
Cleaned the data by handling missing values, parsing dates, and normalizing fund categories.

Risk & Return Analysis:
Calculated returns using CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate).
Assessed risk through standard deviation and Sharpe ratio.

Comparison:
Visualized the performance of various funds over time using line charts and bar plots.

Recommendations:
Offered insights into which funds align best with low-risk or high-return preferences.

Tech Stack:
Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, Seaborn)
Datasets for Mutual Fund data

Outcome:
Enabled users to evaluate mutual fund performance, balance risk, and maximize potential returns through data-driven insights.

3. ChatGPT Reviews Analysis
This project involves analyzing customer reviews of ChatGPT to understand user sentiment, identify key themes, and derive actionable insights for improving the service.

Features:

Data Collection:
Gathered reviews from online sources, including feedback forums, app reviews, and surveys.

Data Cleaning:
Standardized text data by removing noise such as special characters, stopwords, and irrelevant entries.

Sentiment Analysis:
Utilized NLTK and TextBlob for sentiment classification (positive, negative, neutral).
Extracted key phrases and recurring themes using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Visualization:
Bar charts for sentiment distribution.
Word clouds for frequently mentioned keywords.
Heatmaps to show correlations between review metrics.

Tech Stack:
Python (pandas, NumPy, NLTK, TextBlob, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
NLP Techniques

Outcome:
Revealed areas of improvement for ChatGPT by analyzing user sentiment and identifying frequently requested features.
